# AskMoreXtension

This software package provides eight Java operations developed at the Digital Academy of the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz that may be used to create custom actions within the Oxygen XML Editor. A documentation of all operations can be found in the [wiki of this repository](https://github.com/digicademy/AskMoreXtension/wiki).


# Requirements
The AskMoreXtension was developed and tested to be used with the versions 19.1 to 21.0 of the [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/).


# Download and Installation
All releases can be downloaded as a .jar file from the [release page of this repository](https://github.com/digicademy/AskMoreXtension/releases).

You can include the package into your own Oxygen framework by adding a released JAR to the classpath. Please find notes on how to do this in the [official documentation of the ClassPath Tab](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/19.1/ug-editor/topics/document-type-classpath-tab.html).
